        "notes": "Based on recent performance and quality of competition, my expectation for this game leans towards UCF. While Nebraska has shown the ability to beat ranked teams, their recent form of 4-6 in their last 10 games is concerning. I predict with moderate certainty given both teams' inconsistent performances throughout the season. Results are somewhat skewed toward UCF due to their impressive showing against elite Big 12 competition, particularly their close games with Houston and Kansas. The neutral court in Las Vegas somewhat normalizes the outcome distribution, though there is a moderate risk of extreme outcomes given both teams' volatile scoring patterns. UCF's higher scoring offense (80.1 points per game) against Nebraska's defense (72.8 points allowed) suggests an advantage, while both teams' shooting percentages are comparable. UCF's strong offensive rebounding could be a key differentiator in what projects to be a competitive game.",

        "notes": "Given the available data, I predict the outcome centers around a UCF victory with moderate confidence. Recent performance indicators point strongly toward UCF's advantage, with their stronger showing in the highly competitive Big 12 conference being particularly telling. Results are likely skewed toward a UCF win, considering their impressive close games against top-tier opponents like Houston and Kansas. The Knights' superior offensive output (80.1 points per game) compared to Nebraska's defensive allowance (72.8) suggests a meaningful advantage. I have relatively high certainty in this prediction given UCF's better recent form (7-3 in last 10) compared to Nebraska's struggling stretch (4-6). Their competitive showing against elite competition, particularly the narrow loss to championship finalist Houston, demonstrates their capability at a high level. The threat of extreme outcomes is moderate, as both teams have shown the ability to compete with ranked opponents.",

        "notes": "Given the recent performance metrics and competitive context, I expect a closely contested game. UCF has shown stronger recent form, winning 7 of their last 10 games while playing in the tougher Big 12 conference, and notably pushing powerhouses like Kansas and Houston to the limit. While Nebraska has notable wins against ranked teams earlier in the season, their recent form is concerning with just 4 wins in their last 10 games. The scoring dynamics suggest an advantage for UCF, who average 80.1 points per game compared to Nebraska's defensive allowance of 72.8. I predict with moderate certainty due to both teams' inconsistent performances against quality opponents. Results are slightly skewed toward UCF given their stronger conference schedule and better recent form.

My analysis of their competitive showings against top-tier Big 12 teams, particularly their close games with Houston and Kansas, suggests they're performing at a higher level than their record indicates. The Knights' superior offensive output and momentum from their 7-3 record in the last 10 games gives me high confidence in their chances. While Nebraska has some impressive wins against ranked teams, their recent 4-6 record and defensive struggles are concerning. The results are somewhat skewed towards a UCF victory, particularly given their offensive rebounding advantage and scoring prowess. Their ability to put up 83.1 points in their last 10 games against tough Big 12 competition suggests they match up well against Nebraska's defense that allows 72.8 points per game. There's moderate uncertainty in the prediction due to the tournament's inaugural nature and neutral site location, but the data points strongly toward UCF's advantages.",
