        "notes": "Based on the comprehensive analysis of both teams' performances, I expect a competitive game with UCF holding a slight advantage. My prediction reflects moderate certainty given both teams' inconsistent performances against quality opponents. The Knights' recent form (7-3 in last 10) and their competitive showings against top-tier Big 12 teams, particularly the close games with Houston and Kansas, suggest they're playing at a high level. Results are somewhat skewed toward UCF's favor due to their stronger offensive output (80.1 points per game) compared to Nebraska's defensive allowance (72.8 points). While Nebraska has impressive wins over ranked opponents, their recent form (4-6 in last 10) and scoring differential in recent games suggests more vulnerability. The outcomes are concentrated around my mean prediction with moderate tail risk, considering both teams have demonstrated the ability to compete with elite programs.",

        "notes": "Given the current form and statistics, I predict with moderate uncertainty about the outcome. My analysis centers around a meaningful chance of defeat for UCF, considering Nebraska's impressive record against ranked opponents this season. Results are notably skewed toward a UCF loss, particularly given Nebraska's stronger conference competition and proven ability to compete at a high level. UCF's recent performance in the Big 12 against top teams like Houston and Kansas, while encouraging, showed they struggled to close out important games. Nebraska's defensive rebounding advantage and UCF's relatively weaker shooting percentage against Big Ten-caliber opponents suggest a concentrated likelihood around my central estimate. The tournament setting and neutral court in Las Vegas somewhat increases outcome variance, but I maintain relatively tight confidence bounds given both teams' recent performance patterns.",

        "notes": "Based on the comprehensive analysis of both teams' performances, I expect a closely contested game with UCF holding a slight advantage. My certainty in this prediction is moderate, given both teams have shown inconsistent performances throughout the season. The results are somewhat skewed toward UCF due to their impressive showing against top-tier competition in the Big 12, particularly their close games against Houston and Kansas. Their higher scoring average and recent form (7-3 in last 10) suggests better momentum compared to Nebraska's 4-6 record. However, Nebraska's proven ability to defeat ranked opponents this season introduces meaningful uncertainty.

UCF's experience against tough Big 12 competition, including close games with elite teams like Houston and Kansas, suggests they are battle-tested, but I believe this actually creates uncertainty in their performance against Nebraska. The Knights' offensive output has been strong recently, but Nebraska's defensive metrics and wins against ranked opponents make me less confident in UCF's chances. Looking at momentum, UCF's 7-3 record in their last 10 games is promising, but Nebraska's success against ranked opponents throughout the season creates substantial doubt. The distribution of possible outcomes is skewed towards Nebraska's favor, particularly given their more impressive wins against ranked opponents.

The results are somewhat skewed toward a UCF victory, making a loss less likely but still quite possible. There's significant uncertainty in this prediction given it's a championship game environment where pressure can be a major factor.

I predict with moderate certainty given both teams' inconsistent seasons, but UCF's competitive showings against top-tier opponents like Houston and Kansas are particularly telling. Results are slightly skewed towards UCF's favor considering their superior scoring average (80.1 points per game) compared to Nebraska's defensive allowance (72.8 points). Their performance against common high-caliber opponents suggests they are better prepared for this matchup, though there is a moderate risk of extreme outcomes given both teams' volatile performances throughout the season.

The results are slightly skewed toward a lower probability of UCF losing, considering their strong showing against elite teams like Houston and Kansas, though they didn't secure those wins.

The scoring patterns suggest a fairly uncertain outcome, though UCF's recent offensive output has been strong. Results are somewhat skewed toward UCF maintaining their recent form, but Nebraska's defensive capabilities could prove disruptive.
