Q: What is the probability that Ole Miss will win against Michigan State in their Sweet 16 matchup?

Pred: (37.62%*, 62.38%)

The outcome distribution reflects some potential for an upset given Ole Miss's defensive prowess and their ability to create turnovers, but Michigan State's balanced attack and superior rebounding capabilities suggest they have multiple paths to victory. Their results are concentrated around a moderate probability range rather than suggesting extreme outcomes in either direction.
