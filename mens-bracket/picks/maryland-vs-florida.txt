Q: What is the probability that Maryland (4) will win against Florida (1) in their Sweet 16 matchup?

Pred: (36.71%*, 63.29%)

The game's outcome is likely to be concentrated around Florida's victory scenario, though there remains a meaningful chance for Maryland to pull off the upset given their tournament experience and defensive prowess. The matchup dynamics suggest moderate volatility in potential outcomes, particularly if Maryland can successfully disrupt Florida's offensive rhythm.
